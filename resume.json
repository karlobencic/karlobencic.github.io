Since the concept of reliability in DLT systems is not adequately solved by cryptographic security, we arrive at the concept of data truthfulness as a new property needed to characterize reliable, decentralized systems. A decentralized oracle makes DLT useful by allowing the entry of non-confidential data into the system in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central entity, which eliminates a single point of failure.",
