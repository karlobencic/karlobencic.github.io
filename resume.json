Furthermore, an in-depth analysis and detailed comparison of existing approaches to solving the oracle problem was carried out with regard to the requirements obtained from the challenge of reliable connection of the blockchain and external data sources. Since the concept of reliability in DLT systems is not adequately solved by cryptographic security, we arrive at the concept of data truthfulness as a new property needed to characterize reliable, decentralized systems. A decentralized oracle makes DLT useful by allowing the entry of non-confidential data into the system in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central entity, which eliminates a single point of failure.",
